## Training in Test Driven Development

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that test, and finally refactors the new code to acceptable standards.

## Instructions

Follow these instructions:

1. Read [this article](http://agiledata.org/essays/tdd.html) to get the theory behind this methodology.

2. Clone the repository.

3. Open the solution in Visual Studio.

4. Implement the tests (Each exercise is described [here](https://github.com/ScioMx/TDD-Training/wiki)).

5. Implement the code.

6. Push to your repository.

## About the exercises
